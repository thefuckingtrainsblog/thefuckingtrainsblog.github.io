<h1>Oct 20th - 2024</h1>
<p>It's starting to kick in, the missing you. Even more so now that i'm settling in. The apartment is nicer than my house jaja and right next to a forest / bike path. I thought of you because I thought you would like it here and imagined us chilling on this cozy ass couch together watching the trees blow. </p>

<p>Denmark has been pretty awesome so far. There is a scenic fairytale land that the train passed through called Vejle. I thought this country was flat, but going through that portion was epic hills with water views with the cutest of houses. Also: there was a mother reading her daughter a story book in Danish and I coudln't help but smile at the awesomeness of the moment. Everyone is tall and blond here so I was able to easily find clothes that fit. I am tall but not blond, and so far vibe with this country.</p>

<p>I was daydreaming about you last night. The longing seems to grow as the distance becomes real. Hopefully it won't plague me as long as last time. Then I listened to this song as a partial coincidence and it was the first time I really heard / related to the lyrics so they motivated me to share with you as it is exactly how I feel.</p>

<div class="lyrics">
<br/>
<p>Last night I dreamt we did our laundry together</p>
<p>And we were singing the same song</p>
<p>While we folded our clothes</p>
<p>As I recall, you looked like a total doofus</p>
<p>Which is pretty accurate</p>
<br/>
<p>So I woke up feeling sad</p>
<p>'Cause it never happened</p>
<p>'Cause it never happened</p>
<p>'Cause it never happened</p>
<p>'Cause it never happened</p>
<br/>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</p>
<p>Eliza, I'm leaving you a voicemail</p>
<p>I'm calling to talk to you on the phone</p>
<p>Hey, I hope you're expecting to take a voicemail?</p>
<p>'Cause I'm leaving you one now</p>
<p>How do I get to your house? Okay, bye</p>
<br/>
<p>Hello, Eliza, are you awake?</p>
<p>Are you on your way, dear?</p>
<p>Give me a call, bye bye</p>
<p>Hello? (Hello?)</p>
<p>(Hello?)</p>
<p>Hold on</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<br/>
<p>Hold the door for Tippy and Zelda</p>
<p>To the basement floor with a song or two</p>
<p>Happy birthday and hail this country</p>
<p>Howling to an electric moon</p>
<br/>
<p>Tippy sleeps and Zelda's shrinking</p>
<p>Perhaps, one day, they'll meet once more</p>
<p>But for now, Zelda's heart's still laughing</p>
<p>And when I see her, I will hold the door</p>
